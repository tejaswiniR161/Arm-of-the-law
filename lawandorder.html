                Law & Order </h2>
            <p style="font-size:medium">
                Law and order issue is assuming importance day after day with individuals belonging to all sections of society zealously clamour for exercising their rights which include both real or assumed ones. When these rights clash with one another there arises a situation necessitating the intervention by the police in the larger interests of the safety of the public. Rights and duties are the two sides of the same coin and one who exercises his rights has the corresponding duties to perform. Exercising rights unfettered and with no duty towards the society leads to the survival of the strongest and the decimation of the meekest. In our country we have various fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution in consonance with democracy but they are not absolute. They can be exercised subject to reasonable restrictions listed in the constitution itself in the interest of public. 
                <br />
                Police cannot work in vacuum and without the cooperation of the public, they cannot perform their fundamental duty of protecting life, property and rights of people. Liberty and safety co-exist, either we will have both or we will have neither. Both are not repugnant but only complementary to each other. Our fundamental right to swing our arms ends where our neighbour&#39;s nose begins as famously told by Herold Laski, a great votary of democracy. 
                <br />
                Bangalore has a cosmopolitan outlook with people from across the globe with the background of different cultures, ethnicity visit and settle in the city. Laws give protection to all transcending national, religious, cultural barriers. If there is any transgression of law by any one, be they our own countrymen or brethren from other countries law will take its own course and no one is permitted to take law into their own their hands. 
                <br />
               <!-- In order to keep our lanes and by lanes, bus stands and railway stations, business centers and residential areas free of violence, members of public are to cooperate with the police so that everyone can move, do business, avocation, and settle peacefully. Basically no one wants trouble in their vicinity and neighbourhood and as such even when trouble brews, two things are necessarily expected from the enlightened public, one to inform the police promptly and another to confine themselves to home and let the police handle the matter effectively. Police are to be trusted as it is enjoined upon them as a top priority to bring the situation back to normal as fast as possible.
                <br />-->
                Police and the law abiding public have common interest in ushering in peace as the presence of good law and order is the condition precedent for all constructive human activities in any area.

            <h2>
               Appeal to the public 
            </h2>
            <ul style="width: 876px; font-size:medium">
            <li>Public should avoid indulging in competitive breaking of law and order as a wise statement says fighting fire with fire always ends in ashes.</li>
            <li>Residents should always realise that if they respect law, order will follow automatically. </li>
            <li>If some people feel that they can always get away after committing crimes they are wrong for the long arm of law will definitely catch up with them any time if not soon. </li>
            <li>Every member of the public should feel that he is a policeman without uniform and he has also a role in maintaining order in the society by assisting the authorities in giving information about the impending break down of law and order (arrangement would be made to protect their identity) and also aid the police in apprehending the offenders when requested by them.</li>
